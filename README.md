# functional-java
This git repository contains the code for the Assignment III.

Project Structure
-----------------

We have the following classes:

* `Learning.java`. You can ignore this class (I was playing with lambdas and streams)
* `TextUtil.java`. It contains some util methods for String objects.
* `WordContainer.java`. Is only a wrapper to store the word and its frequency.
* `SolutionA.java`. Has the first solution using an old approach.
* `SolutionF.java`. Has the final solution using streams.
* `Main.java`. It contains the main method of the project.

In order to run the first or the final solution you only have to change the value of RUN_FINAL_SOLUTION.
